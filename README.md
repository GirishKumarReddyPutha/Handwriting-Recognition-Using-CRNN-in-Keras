# Handwriting-Recognition-Using-CRNN-in-Keras
Project Overview:
This project focuses on developing a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) model for the task of handwriting recognition. Utilizing deep learning techniques within the Keras framework, the model is trained to accurately recognize handwritten text from images. This application of CRNN demonstrates the powerful capability of combining convolutional and recurrent networks to process image data and sequence prediction tasks, respectively, making it well-suited for the complexities of handwriting recognition.

Key Features:

Robust Preprocessing: Implements preprocessing steps to prepare handwritten images for model training, including normalization, binarization, and resizing.
CRNN Architecture: Detailed explanation and implementation of the CRNN architecture, combining CNNs for feature extraction and RNNs for sequence prediction.
Training and Evaluation: Comprehensive training process with a focus on loss reduction and accuracy improvement, along with evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
Real-world Application: Demonstrates the model's application on real-world handwritten images, showcasing its effectiveness and potential use cases.
Technologies Used:

Python: Primary programming language for the project.
TensorFlow and Keras: For constructing and training the deep learning model.
OpenCV (cv2): For image preprocessing and augmentations.
NumPy: For numerical and array operations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For visualizing the data and model performance metrics.
This project is ideal for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts interested in machine learning, computer vision, and specifically, the application of deep learning in handwriting recognition. It provides a solid foundation for exploring more complex text recognition tasks and improving upon the current methodologies.
